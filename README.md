# Neural-style-transfer---cats

This python script is designed to to work within an ipython notebook.  Much of the code comes from the deeplearning.ai course on convoluted
nerual networks, however allot has been changed.  

This script is for neural style transfer image generation, combining the content of one image (ie. cat) with the style of another image (ie. painting).
Use this script with the ever so amazing pre-trained VVG-19 model.  Cheers!
